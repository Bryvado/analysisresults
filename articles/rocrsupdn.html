            <h2>By <a href="https://gwhatchet.com/staff_name/bryson-kloesel/">Bryson Kloesel</a>, Reporter</h2>
            <p>Former GW student Brian Joyner last month assumed responsibility for maintaining and managing Rock Creek Park after spending two decades exploring his passions for preservation and D.C.</p>
            <p>The park service late last month appointed Brian Joyner &mdash; who took graduate classes in historic preservation at GW from 2001 to 2004 &mdash; as the superintendent of the District.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Rock Creek Park has always been a part of my life,&rdquo; Joyner said.</p>
            <p>Rock Creek Park is divided into more than 20 green spaces, spanning 2,749 acres. The largest area falls between the National Zoo and Silver Spring, Maryland, making up 1,754 acres, according to the park service.</p>
            <p>Joyner, who served as the park&rsquo;s deputy superintendent since 2022, succeeded Superintendent Julia Washburn, an adjunct professor of educational leadership at GW who served in the role since 2017.</p>
            <p>During his period as acting superintendent at Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Historical Park between 2014 and 2015, Joyner oversaw the park&rsquo;s transition from a national monument to a national historical park.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Learning how to manage that, engage with the politics around that, engage with the communities in that space that had definite feelings about whether the park service should be there, was a big learning curve,&rdquo; Joyner said.</p>
            <p>Joyner&rsquo;s Bevinetto Fellowship, a specialized park service program that the park service selected him for in 2015, involved analyzing legislation, communicating the park service&rsquo;s priorities to Congress and other stakeholders, and learning about the agency&rsquo;s inner workings.</p>
            <p>While taking historic preservation classes at GW, Joyner said he worked a full-time job at the park service as an editor for the Cultural Resources Diversity Program at Rock Creek Park.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;I would get done with work, leave work at like 4 o&rsquo;clock and try to get over as fast as I could to GW to get to my 4:30 class,&rdquo; Joyner said.</p>
            <p>Balancing graduate courses and a full-time job, Joyner said he never forged a strong connection with the GW community but instead grew an appreciation for the Foggy Bottom campus by spending time in the area.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Going to sit in Washington [Circle] if I had some time to kill before and after class or going down 23rd street to get over toward the Lincoln Memorial,&rdquo; Joyner said.</p>
            <p>Joyner later co-authored &ldquo;Hispanic Heroes Walking Tour of Washington, D.C.&rdquo; in 2012, a short guide to seven culturally significant stops along Virginia Avenue, the southern edge of the GW campus.</p>
            <p>As superintendent, Joyner said he wants to document in the park service&rsquo;s collections how traditions like Native Americans&rsquo; 50-year-old annual drum circle at Meridian Hill Park have persisted and adapted over the years.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;This park, like all parks, has a life of its own, and you need to spend time in it to understand what that is,&rdquo; Joyner said.</p>
            <p>Joyner said he will oversee significant rehabilitation efforts at Rock Creek Park, focusing on the restoration of two major facilities &mdash; the Rock Creek Golf Course and Carter Barron Amphitheatre.</p>
            <p>The amphitheater closed in 2017 after facing years of structural and accessibility issues and caught on fire in 2022. The park service plans to overhaul the 100-year-old golf course later this year, Joyner said.</p>
            <p>Joyner said he plans to engage community members in the projects because park boundaries are scattered throughout residential districts like Georgetown and Fort Totten. As deputy superintendent, he worked closely with the community to address concerns and ensure the park&rsquo;s needs were met.</p>
            <p>&ldquo;Our borders are fairly porous, in some ways, they literally abut people&rsquo;s backyards,&rdquo; Joyner said. &ldquo;It is incumbent upon the park, and I think the park service as a whole, to make sure that we are good neighbors.&rdquo;</p>
