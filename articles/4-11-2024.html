                    <h2>By Bryson Kloesel, Reporter</h2>

                    <p>The National Capital Planning Commission reiterated their commitment to reconfiguring major roadways between the Kennedy Center and Foggy Bottom at a meeting last week.</p>

                    <p>During the discussion on April 4, Senior Planner Matthew Flis presented urban planning and development initiatives around the Kennedy Center over the past year, including a report on the progress and future plans.</p>

                    <p>The D.C. architectural group AIA/DC provided pro bono design explorations for the region, which include adding a deck over the highway to improve connectivity in the Foggy Bottom area surrounding the Kennedy Center.</p>

                    <p>The proposal aims to add approximately 27 acres of usable park space to the area, including dedicated park areas between GW’s Foggy Bottom campus and the Kennedy Center. It would also include the addition of the National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial at the corner of Constitution Avenue and 23rd Street.</p>

                    <p>Traffic would be redirected around Benito Juárez Circle at the intersection of Virginia and New Hampshire avenues, transforming the circle into a green space and pedestrian-friendly area.</p>   
                    
                    <blockquote>“We’re excited about the work that’s completed,” Flis said.</blockquote>

                    <p>NCPC commissioners emphasized the importance of integrating the Kennedy Center’s future into ongoing planning efforts to ensure a cohesive space. Commissioner Mina Wright noted that holistic planning is essential for the success of the project.</p>

                    <blockquote>“All they were thinking about was traffic and speed,” Wright said.</blockquote>
