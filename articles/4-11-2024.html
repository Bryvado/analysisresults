            <h2>By Bryson Kloesel, Reporter</h2>

            <p>The National Capital Planning Commission reiterated their commitment to reconfiguring major roadways between the Kennedy Center and Foggy Bottom at a meeting last week.</p>

            <p>During the conversation on April 4, Senior Planner Matthew Flis discussed the urban planning and development initiatives around the Kennedy Center over the past year, including a report released in February that recommends establishing a Kennedy Center Cultural District. This district would help facilitate proposed land use changes to the area.</p>

            <p>The D.C. architectural group AIA/DC provided pro bono design explorations for the region, which include adding a deck over the highway to improve connectivity in the Foggy Bottom area surrounding the I-66 freeway.</p>

            <p>The proposal aims to add approximately 27 acres of usable park space to the area, including dedicated park areas between GW’s Foggy Bottom campus and the Kennedy Center. It would also remove highway tunnels and ramps near E Street to create more open space.</p>

            <p>In addition, the proposal includes a plan to add the National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial at the corner of Constitution Avenue and 23rd Street.</p>

            <p>Traffic would be redirected around Benito Juárez Circle at the intersection of Virginia and New Hampshire avenues, transforming the circle into a green space and pedestrian-friendly area. The design also intends to convert the service road in front of the Watergate complex into a pedestrian walkway.</p>

            <blockquote>“We’re excited about the work that’s completed,” Flis said.</blockquote>

            <p>NCPC commissioners emphasized the importance of integrating the Kennedy Center’s future into ongoing planning efforts to ensure a cohesive space. Commissioner Mina Wright noted that historically, highway design has prioritized vehicles over the safety and convenience of pedestrians and cyclists.</p>

            <blockquote>“All they were thinking about was traffic and speed,” Wright said.</blockquote>
